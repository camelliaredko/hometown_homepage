          <h2>4-H Children's Garden</h2>
          <p>
            4-H Children's Garden is an outdoor garden complex inside Michigan
            State University. It first opened in 1993 and was the first garden
            in the United States developed to educate young children on a
            university campus. It draws in over 100,000 visitors per year and is
            nationally renowned for its technological innovations. The garden is
            a great place for children to learn about botany and science; it
            also offers interactive activities to help students develop their
            green thumb. Its mission is to promote understanding of plants and
            the roles they play in our lives, nurture the wonder, imagination,
            and curiosity of a child, and provide a spot of delight and
            enrichment in children of any age. Your kids can visit their themed
            gardens with names like Sunburst Entrance or Imagination Arbor and
            take their Butterfly Tours to study butterflies and make related
            crafts.
